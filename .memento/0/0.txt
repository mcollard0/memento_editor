Welcome to Memento!

This is your first memento. Memento automatically saves your work as you type, maintaining a ring buffer of versions so you never lose your progress.

Key features:
• Auto-saves after 50 characters or 1.5 seconds of inactivity
• Ring buffer versioning (3-50 save points based on file size)  
• Export to external files with Ctrl+S
• Multiple mementos for different documents
• Clean, distraction-free writing interface

Start typing to see the auto-save in action!
