# üåê Chrome OCR on Wayland - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç **The Problem**
Chrome windows cannot be individually targeted on Wayland due to security restrictions. This affects:
- `xdotool` window selection
- `wmctrl` window listing  
- Direct window ID capture

## ‚úÖ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Use Full Screenshot Mode (Recommended)**
The OCR system automatically falls back to full screenshot when window selection fails:

```bash
# In the GUI, leave Window ID empty or just click "Capture & Test All"
# The system will capture the full screen and process it
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ Works reliably on Wayland
- ‚úÖ Captures all visible content
- ‚úÖ AI can still detect text input boxes in full screenshots

### **Option 2: Switch to X11 Session (Temporary)**
For precise window targeting:

1. **Log out** of your current session
2. At the login screen, click the **gear icon** ‚öôÔ∏è
3. Select **"Ubuntu on Xorg"** instead of **"Ubuntu"**
4. Log in - now Chrome window selection will work

### **Option 3: Use Chrome in Focus Mode**
Maximize Chrome and ensure it's the only visible window:

1. **Maximize Chrome** (F11 for fullscreen)
2. **Focus on the text input fields** you want to test
3. **Run the OCR system** - full screenshot will capture just Chrome

## üéØ **Best Practices for Chrome OCR Testing**

### **Prepare Chrome for Testing:**
1. **Open a page with forms** (Gmail, contact forms, search boxes)
2. **Zoom in if needed** (Ctrl + +) for better text clarity
3. **Use high contrast themes** for better OCR accuracy
4. **Avoid busy backgrounds** - use simple, clean pages

### **Testing Workflow:**
1. **Open Chrome with target content**
2. **Launch OCR tester**: `python3 ocr_accuracy_tester.py`
3. **Leave Window ID empty** (for full screenshot mode)
4. **Click "Capture & Test All"**
5. **Approve screenshot permissions** if prompted
6. **Wait for 3-second countdown**
7. **System captures full screen** and processes with all AI services
8. **Rate the accuracy** based on how well each service captured text from forms

## üß™ **Test Chrome Pages**

### **Good Test Pages:**
- **Gmail compose** - lots of text input fields
- **Google Forms** - various input types
- **Contact forms** on websites
- **Search pages** with input boxes
- **Login/registration pages**

### **What to Look For:**
- **Text input boxes** (email, password fields)
- **Textarea content** (message bodies)
- **Dropdown selections**
- **Button labels**
- **Form field labels**

## üîß **Verification Steps**

### **Test if Chrome is Accessible:**
```bash
# This should show no results on Wayland:
xdotool search --name "chrome"

# This should show Chrome processes:
ps aux | grep chrome | grep -v grep
```

### **Test Full Screenshot:**
```bash
# This should work and create a screenshot:
grim chrome_test.png
```

### **Test the OCR System:**
```bash
# This will use full screenshot mode:
python3 test_enhanced_ocr.py
```

## üìä **Expected Results with Chrome**

Since Chrome content is mostly text in input fields, the AI services should perform well:

- **Tesseract:** Good for simple text inputs, may struggle with complex layouts
- **OpenAI Vision:** Excellent at understanding form structure and extracting input text
- **Anthropic Vision:** Very good at detecting form fields and their content
- **XAI Vision:** Good general text recognition

## üõ†Ô∏è **Advanced Chrome Testing**

### **Chrome Developer Tools:**
1. Open **Chrome DevTools** (F12)
2. Use **Elements tab** to see actual form structure
3. Compare what AI services capture vs. what's actually in the DOM

### **Chrome Extensions:**
Consider testing with extensions that add form fields:
- Password managers (show input field detection)
- Form fillers (lots of text to recognize)

## üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Use Chrome's zoom feature** (Ctrl + +) to make text larger for better OCR
2. **Enable Chrome's high contrast mode** for clearer text boundaries
3. **Use Incognito mode** to avoid extension interference
4. **Test different websites** to see how AI handles various form styles
5. **Focus on actual form fields** rather than general page content

The enhanced OCR system is designed to work with this Wayland limitation and will provide accurate results even without individual window targeting.
